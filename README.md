# CSE341-course-part-A-solutions-written-in-ELM - Winter, 2013

  My favourite course on functional programming so far. The solutions were originally asked to be written in SML, 
 but I encourage everyone, especially those who are new to programming, to first solve them in ELM instead of SML, 
 mainly because of the great error messages the ELM repl has, and because ELM is a very usefull functional language 
 to learn these days.

 Cheers!
